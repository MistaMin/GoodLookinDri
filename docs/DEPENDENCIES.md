# Dependencies and licensing

GoodLookinDri is MIT licensed, copyright 2026 Marcos Quirino Deida. See the root [LICENSE](../LICENSE).

The core crate depends only on the Rust standard library. The optional `goodlookindri-shell` crate adds one pinned dependency, `fontdue`, for text. `cargo test` uses the built-in test harness. Nothing is downloaded at build time besides the Rust toolchain you already installed.

Documentation images in `docs/images` are renders of the control catalogue, produced by this repository's `render_page` and `render_demo` examples. They are part of this repository and covered by the same MIT license. They are reference pictures, not runtime assets. The library does not load them.

GoodLookinDri does not vendor a plugin framework, a window system, a font, or an FFT library. The spectrum transform is implemented in `src/spectrum.rs`.

If you replay `Scene` through another graphics library, that library keeps its own license. Linking GoodLookinDri does not relicense your plugin.
